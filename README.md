# Allegro

This package implements the Allegro E(3)-equivariant machine-learning interatomic potential (https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05249).

In particular, `allegro` implements the Allegro model as an **extension package** to the [NequIP package](https://github.com/mir-group/nequip).


## Installation
**Please note that this package CANNOT be installed from PyPI as `pip install allegro`.**

`allegro` requires the `nequip` package and its dependencies; please see the [NequIP installation instructions](https://github.com/mir-group/nequip#installation) for details.

Once `nequip` is installed, you can install `allegro` from source by running:
```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/mir-group/allegro.git
cd allegro
pip install .
```

## Tutorial
The best way to learn how to use Allegro is through the [Colab Tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yq2UwnET4loJYg_Fptt9kpklVaZvoHnq). This will run entirely on Google's cloud virtual machine, you do not need to install or run anything locally.

## Usage
Allegro models are trained, evaluated, deployed, etc. identically to NequIP models using the `nequip-*` commands. See the [NequIP README](https://github.com/mir-group/nequip#usage) for details.

The key difference between using an Allegro and NequIP model is in the options used to define the model. We provide two Allegro config files analogous to those in `nequip`:
 - [`configs/minimal.yaml`](`configs/minimal.yaml`): A minimal example of training a toy model on force data.
 - [`configs/example.yaml`](`configs/example.yaml`): Training a more realistic model on forces and energies. **Start here for real models!**

The key option that tells `nequip` to build an Allegro model is the `model_builders` option, which we set to:
```yaml
model_builders:
 - allegro.model.Allegro
 # the typical model builders from `nequip` are still used to wrap the core Allegro energy model:
 - PerSpeciesRescale
 - ForceOutput
 - RescaleEnergyEtc
```

## LAMMPS Integration

We offer a LAMMPS plugin [`pair_allegro`](https://github.com/mir-group/pair_allegro) to use Allegro models in LAMMPS simulations, including support for Kokkos acceleration and MPI and parallel simulations. Please see the [`pair_allegro`](https://github.com/mir-group/pair_allegro) repository for more details.

The implementation of Allegro is built on NequIP [1], our framework for E(3)-equivariant interatomic potentials, and e3nn, [2] a general framework for building E(3)-equivariant neural networks.
