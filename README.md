# Allegro

This package implements the [Allegro E(3)-equivariant machine learning interatomic potential](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36329-y).

In particular, `allegro` implements the Allegro model as an **extension package** for the [NequIP framework](https://github.com/mir-group/nequip).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A [major backwards-incompatible update](https://nequip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/upgrading.html) to the `nequip` framework was released on April 23rd 2025 as version v0.7.0. The corresponding `allegro` version is v0.4.0. Previous versions of Allegro remain available if needed in the GitHub Releases and must be used with older versions of `nequip`.

## Installation

`allegro` requires the `nequip` package. Details on `nequip` and its required PyTorch versions can be found in [the `nequip` docs](https://nequip.readthedocs.io).

`allegro` can be installed from PyPI (note that it is known as `nequip-allegro` on PyPI):
```bash
pip install nequip-allegro
```
Installing `allegro` in this way will also install the `nequip` package from PyPI.

## Usage

The `allegro` package provides the Allegro model for use within the [NequIP framework](https://github.com/mir-group/nequip).
[The framework's documentation](https://nequip.readthedocs.io) describes how  to train, test, and use models.
A minimal example of a config file for training an Allegro model is provided at [`configs/tutorial.yaml`](configs/tutorial.yaml) and further details can be found in the [Allegro docs](https://nequip.readthedocs.io/projects/allegro/en/latest/).


## LAMMPS Integration

We offer a LAMMPS plugin [`pair_allegro`](https://github.com/mir-group/pair_nequip_allegro) to use Allegro models in LAMMPS simulations, including support for Kokkos acceleration, MPI, and parallel multi-GPU simulations.

## Community, contact, questions, and contributing

If you find a bug or have a proposal for a feature, please post it in the [Issues](https://github.com/mir-group/allegro/issues).
If you have a self-contained question or other discussion topic, try our [GitHub Disucssions](https://github.com/mir-group/allegro/discussions).

**If your post is related to the NequIP software framework in general, please post in the issues or discussions on [that repository](https://github.com/mir-group/nequip).** Discussions on this repository should be specific to the `allegro` package and Allegro model.

Active users and interested developers are invited to join us on the NequIP community chat server, which is hosted on the excellent [Zulip](https://zulip.com/) software.
Zulip is organized a little bit differently than chat software like Slack or Discord that you may be familiar with: please review [their introduction](https://zulip.com/help/introduction-to-topics) before posting.
